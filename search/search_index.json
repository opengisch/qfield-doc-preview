The goal is to improve the geologic mapping workflow by entering data directly in the field, create quality data with consistent terms, and reference existing geoscience data in the field. Project preparation \u00b6 Prior to starting in QField, a geologic mapping geopackage was designed to collect vector data including point station, structure, photo, and sample layers as well as line and polygon layers for contacts, faults, alteration, and geology. Attribute fields are customized for ease of data entry and data quality assurance using value maps, defaults (value or expression), and constraints within the Attributes Form. For example, the structural layer includes: Coordinates Fields with default value x and y coordinates from GPS data Structure type Value map (drop down list) with structural features (e.g., bedding, cleavage, lineation), set with a \"not null\" constraint Azimuth and dip Integers with range set from 0-360 and 0-90, respectively Date Default value current date and time when feature created ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Symbology and labels are customized for each layer, including embedded SVG symbols for structural features that are rotated with the azimuth field. In addition to field data, base maps and historic data are compiled into geopackages for reference. Base maps include vector topographic data and raster orthophotos.

Accurate mapping and monitoring patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at an appropriate scale is important for informing landscape management, policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Fiji's Ministry of Forestry is collaboratively developing an approach with the Universities of Sydney (USYD), Western Australia (UWA) and the South Pacific (USP) to produce an inter-annual LULC map using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and freely available geospatial tools. QFIeld is being used for collecting ground truth data in the landscape for training and validation of the LULC map. Workflow \u00b6 The LULC ground truth collection form was designed in QGIS. A set of predefined ground truth plot locations were generated based on a stratification of satellite data within the study area. The form, predefined plots, and appropriate offline background layers were packaged in QGIS and then loaded onto each of the tablets used by the field team (Figure 1). A team member navigated to a predefined plot in QField and created a ground truth point at the location and labelled the point with the most appropriate pre-defined LULC class (Figure 2). Data collected from all tablets was combined into one ground truth data collection in QGIS. Image interpretation using the OpenForis platform will be used to increase the number of ground truth plots. The final ground truth collection will be imported into Google Earth Engine to produce the LULC map and calculate the map accuracy. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Preliminary Results and Future Work \u00b6 An example of a preliminary land cover map is shown in Figure 3. An important objective from our work is to transfer skills and build capacity with local stakeholders to continue to update the LULC map on an annual basis as well as to expand the map to include other communities, catchments and forestry areas across Fiji. This capacity building will include iterative stakeholder consultation, online training materials, field and classroom training workshops, and collaborative fieldwork. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Acknowledgement \u00b6 We would like to thank the field team from the Fiji Ministry of Forestry especially Viliame Tupua and Renata Varea (USP).

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation \u00b6 We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work \u00b6 On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"de/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast. Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost.","title":"Goal and field constraints :"},{"location":"de/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#project-preparation","text":"We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data .

Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava'u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making. Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced. Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation \u00b6 We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work \u00b6 On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"de/old-doc/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost.","title":"Goal and field constraints :"},{"location":"de/old-doc/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#project-preparation","text":"We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet.","title":"Project preparation"},{"location":"de/old-doc/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#field-work","text":"On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} :::","title":"Field work"},{"location":"de/old-doc/case-studies/river-state-survey/","text":"Goal \u00b6 In order to assess the structural and morphological state of their water courses, the community of Milvignes needed to survey all the rivers crossing their territory.

Keep it simple \u00b6 The requirements on the field are not the same as on a desktop. The screen is smaller, the input devices are different and the tasks are different. QField aims to help the user to perform the tasks he needs to do without cluttering the user interface. This means, that only tasks which need to be done on the field are availble from the interface. Everything else is not. This means that everything like layer styling, form definitions and other project setup steps should be done on a computer with QGIS installed first. Be compatible with QGIS \u00b6 QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really does use QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS for desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on your mobile device as it does on your computer. If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS project, it should not be re-invented. QField therefore uses the same edit widgets as QGIS desktop does.

Developing QField under this license means that you can inspect and modify the source code and guarantees that you will always have access to a QGIS based field data collection app that is free of cost and can be freely modified. You can find the sourcecode on github Support \u00b6 You can ask your questions on gis.stackexchange You can use the user mailing list We also provide commercial support, contact us Make it grow, make it yours \u00b6 This is a list of features which we think are very useful for a nice user experience and an effective workflow. Edit widgets \u00b6 Edit widgets are a core part of efficient field work. Entering attributes on a touch device is one of the jobs that takes the most time and keeping this task as easy as possible is key for pleasuring work. Some important edit field widgets are already available<old_edit_field_widgets> but much more is possible for example in QGIS . Legend \u00b6 To properly interpret the contents of a map, a legend is a very useful tool. It gives a user the required context to understand the semantic meaning of colors, shapes, strokes and other visual coding. It can also be used to access additional meta data of individual layers or chose which layer to work on. Connection based on-/offline synchronization \u00b6 Data collection is one of the domains where QField can help a lot. The final destination of data is normally not on the device itself but somewhere on a database. Currently it is possible to directly work on the database but since network access is often unreliable when in the field, it boils down to manual synchronization on a desktop computer. It would be great to have a synchronization process running on the devices where data will be synchronized automatically with a server when the network is available and cache data locally whenever no network connection is available. This may be combined with GeoGIG or other server components like a database. Improved coordinate precision \u00b6 Computers work mostly with two different datatypes for storing decimals (floating point numbers) internally. Single and double precision. With single precision only the first 6 digits of a number are significant and can be trusted, with double precision the first 15 digits can be trusted. This takes all digits (before and after the decimal point) into account. When working with coordinates this is very important when a high accurracy is required. Only having 6 significant digits often means having a maximum accurracy around one meter but depends on the CRS and location on the earth surface. Some parts of QField currently treat coordinates with single point precision. It would be a very good improvement to be able to use the full precision of accurate positioning devices by fixing this shortcoming. Saving GPS status information into attributes \u00b6 Positioning devices offer more information than just latitude and longitude. They are also able to estimate the precision which they are currently able to provide. This information can be a radius calculated from variables like the number of satellites but also additional flags for parameters like the RTK status. Editing geometries \u00b6 QField offers to digitize new geometries, edit existing attributes or delete features. What it lacks is the feature to edit existing geometries. This can be split into different pieces like moving points, moving other features, editing vertices, moving edges... Search functionality \u00b6 Locating features with the help of a search field is something that can really help to work more efficient. In general this can be split into two categories: Attribute based search Search results are provided based on the attributes of features on layers within the project. Either a local database for searching is available. The data inside is based on the customized data you work with or the layers are queried directly for features with attributes in question. Geocoding Search results are provided based on real world addresses. Services like Nominatim can be accessed via a web interface and convert real-world addresses to locations on a map. Just try the link. External measurement devices \u00b6 Are you working with external devices with sensors? Air pressure, temperature, slope, carbon monoxide concentration, you name it... Wouldn\\'t it be great to not having to read the information from your external device and manually typing it again? We would love to make life easier for you by adding support for directly connecting your external measurement device to QField. Record Audio \u00b6 Ever wondered how you would write a lot of text when out in the field with a touch screen? Just don\\'t! It would be amazing to have the possibility to have audio integration just like image integration. When back in the office, you could just type in the information on a regular keyboard.

How to turn external SD card into internal storage \u00b6 Starting from Android 6.0, you can use the SD card as internal storage for your Android phone. A feature called Adoptable Storage allows the Android OS to format an external storage media as a permanent internal storage. The data on the adopted SD card is encrypted and it can't be mounted on another device. Please be sure you start with an empty SD card.

Select your \\\"SD Card\\\", then tap the \"three-dot menu\" (top-right), now select \"Settings\" from in there. Now select \"Format as internal\", and then \"Erase & Format\". Your SD Card will now be formatted as internal storage. Reboot your phone. If you don\\'t reboot the phone, many things may not work correctly, so make sure you do. It might be possible that the Adoptable Storage feature is not present on your device even if it is running Android 6.0 and above. The device manufacturer may have disabled the feature.

Therefore we recommend to use stable values such as UUIDs for primary keys. Child features can be added before the parent is finaly saved - means while adding a parent. But it\\'s blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated. In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after there have been some childs added already, the childs are deleted by cascade. Many-To-Many relations On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the QGIS Vector Layer Properties, on adding, deleting or opening an entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality). The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the Display Expression needs to be set on the linking table.

Drag and drop designer forms \u00b6 Groups and Tabs from Drag and Drop designer forms are supported. Conditional visibility \u00b6 Groups can be hidden based on an expression. This is useful when certain attributes are only required under certain conditions. As an example imagine mapping trees. Some of them might have a disease and you have a list of possible deseases.

Default values are inserted into the attribute form when digitizing a new feature. They are visible to the user and can be modified as long as the field is editable. They can be based on the geometry or expression variables. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Additional variables \u00b6 In QField, there are some additional variables available regarding the current positioning information.

[position_timestamp]{.title-ref} (DateTime) : Timestamp of the position information [position_direction]{.title-ref} (float) : Direction in degrees from true north. [position_ground_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : Groundspeed in meters / second. [position_magnetic_variation]{.title-ref} (float) : The angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and true north, in degrees. Also known as magnetic declination. A positive value indicates a clockwise direction from true north and a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise direction. [position_horizontal_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The vertical accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : The value of the vertical speed in meters per second. Common use cases \u00b6 Insert positioning information as variable: @ position_horizontal_accuracy Insert the current date and time: now () Insert the length of the digitized line: length ( $ geometry ) Configure global variables on the device and insert them. @ operator_name If you want to assign a region code based on the location where a new feature is inserted, you can do so by using an aggregate expression: aggregate ( layer : = 'regions' , aggregate : = 'max' , expression : = \"code\" , filter : = intersects ( $ geometry , geometry ( @ parent ) ) ) Editable \u00b6 The editable flag of fields is respected. Remember last values \u00b6 QField offers a much more fine-grained control over the last used values and ignores the QGIS setting. Snapping \u00b6 While digitizing new features, new points can be snapped to existing geometries. All configuration can be done in Project --> Snapping Settings ( Settings --> Snapping Settings {.interpreted-text role=\"menuselection\"} in QGIS 2.x). Snapping Types \u00b6 It is possible to snap new points only to nodes of existing geomtries only to segments of existing geomtries to nodes and segments of existing geomtries Snapping to layers \u00b6 It is also possible to only snap to one or a few layers. Snapping tolerance \u00b6 The snapping tolerance can be specified in map units or pixels. In almost any case, the units should be set to pixels.

QFieldSync supports your project preparation with automating the following: Required steps for project setup (e.g. old_portable_project ) Creating basemaps from a single raster layer or from a style defined in a map theme. Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow \u00b6 To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation \u00b6 In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . Configuration \u00b6 The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration \u00b6 In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration \u00b6 A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration \u00b6 If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield \u00b6 Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes. Synchronize from Qfield \u00b6 When you want to synchronize what you have collected, re-open the project in QGIS (the one you saved with a regular Save As).

This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel.

QFieldSync supports your project preparation with automating the following: Required steps for project setup (e.g. portable_project ) Creating basemaps from a single raster layer or from a style defined in a map theme. Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow \u00b6 To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation \u00b6 In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . Configuration \u00b6 The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration \u00b6 In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration \u00b6 A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration \u00b6 If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield \u00b6 Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes.

Keep it simple \u00b6 The requirements on the field are not the same as on a desktop. The screen is smaller, the input devices are different and the tasks are different. QField aims to help the user to perform the tasks he needs to do without cluttering the user interface. This means, that only tasks which need to be done on the field are availble from the interface. Everything else is not. This means that everything like layer styling, form definitions and other project setup steps should be done on a computer with QGIS installed first. Be compatible with QGIS \u00b6 QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really does use QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS for desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on your mobile device as it does on your computer. If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS project, it should not be re-invented. QField therefore uses the same edit widgets as QGIS desktop does. If a project is already configured for the desktop, it should just run on mobile as well. Remember, this is just the concept . This is what we have in mind when we develop QField. It does not mean that it is already completely there yet. Mode based \u00b6 QField is built around modes . Modes are similar to a map tool in QGIS desktop. A mode defines the task which a user is currently doing. Either a user is browsing through the data or he is digitizing something new.

Accurate mapping and monitoring patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at an appropriate scale is important for informing landscape management, policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Fiji's Ministry of Forestry is collaboratively developing an approach with the Universities of Sydney (USYD), Western Australia (UWA) and the South Pacific (USP) to produce an inter-annual LULC map using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and freely available geospatial tools. QFIeld is being used for collecting ground truth data in the landscape for training and validation of the LULC map. Workflow \u00b6 The LULC ground truth collection form was designed in QGIS. A set of predefined ground truth plot locations were generated based on a stratification of satellite data within the study area. The form, predefined plots, and appropriate offline background layers were packaged in QGIS and then loaded onto each of the tablets used by the field team (Figure 1). A team member navigated to a predefined plot in QField and created a ground truth point at the location and labelled the point with the most appropriate pre-defined LULC class (Figure 2). Data collected from all tablets was combined into one ground truth data collection in QGIS. Image interpretation using the OpenForis platform will be used to increase the number of ground truth plots. The final ground truth collection will be imported into Google Earth Engine to produce the LULC map and calculate the map accuracy. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Preliminary Results and Future Work \u00b6 An example of a preliminary land cover map is shown in Figure 3.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation \u00b6 We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work \u00b6 On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image).

Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava'u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making. Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced. Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.

The application-specific directories on all shared/external storage devices where the application can place persistent files it owns if they are not already included in the primary storage directory. Inside these directories, only subdirectories and files with the \\\".qgs\\\" or \\\".qgz\\\" extension are shown. QField requires the project file to be physically on the device, so it is not possible to use providers that work with remote files (e.g. Google Drive). On the other hand you can use apps like syncthing or nextcloud (or dropbox and probably many others) that allow you tho physically sync the file to your device. External SD card \u00b6 The file selector shows the root of the SD card labeled as \\\"read-only\\\" and the application-specific directory separated from the rest of the SD card, as it is the only directory for which the app has write access. The directory is the following: /Android/data/ch.opengis.qfield/files ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Technically, this is due to the fact that Android intents ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT and ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE, work and grant read-write access on the content of the returning URI, not on the real linked file. This limitation which makes sense for how Android is structured but currently it is unusable with QField as QField needs to access the real file with a real path. ::: Warning! \u00b6 By storing data in this folder, you risk losing data. The application-specific directory ([/Android/data/ch.opengis.qfield/]{.title-ref}) will be deleted by the system if you uninstall QField from your Android device. This is important if you keep the data in the External sd card. How to turn external SD card into internal storage \u00b6 Starting from Android 6.0, you can use the SD card as internal storage for your Android phone. A feature called Adoptable Storage allows the Android OS to format an external storage media as a permanent internal storage. The data on the adopted SD card is encrypted and it can't be mounted on another device. Please be sure you start with an empty SD card. It needs to be empty because when the card is converted to \\\"Internal\\\" storage, it will be formatted (wiped). Go to device \"Settings\", then select \"Storage\". Select your \\\"SD Card\\\", then tap the \"three-dot menu\" (top-right), now select \"Settings\" from in there. Now select \"Format as internal\", and then \"Erase & Format\". Your SD Card will now be formatted as internal storage. Reboot your phone. If you don\\'t reboot the phone, many things may not work correctly, so make sure you do. It might be possible that the Adoptable Storage feature is not present on your device even if it is running Android 6.0 and above. The device manufacturer may have disabled the feature. However, command-line methods exist which allow you to force a device to adopt a storage.","title":"Open a project"},{"location":"en/fieldwork/projects/#favorite-directories","text":"In the first screen of the file selector, there is a section showing the favorite directories.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation \u00b6 We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work \u00b6 On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures).

Keep it simple \u00b6 The requirements on the field are not the same as on a desktop. The screen is smaller, the input devices are different and the tasks are different. QField aims to help the user to perform the tasks he needs to do without cluttering the user interface. This means, that only tasks which need to be done on the field are availble from the interface. Everything else is not. This means that everything like layer styling, form definitions and other project setup steps should be done on a computer with QGIS installed first. Be compatible with QGIS \u00b6 QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really does use QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS for desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on your mobile device as it does on your computer. If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS project, it should not be re-invented. QField therefore uses the same edit widgets as QGIS desktop does. If a project is already configured for the desktop, it should just run on mobile as well. Remember, this is just the concept . This is what we have in mind when we develop QField. It does not mean that it is already completely there yet. Mode based \u00b6 QField is built around modes . Modes are similar to a map tool in QGIS desktop.

Developing QField under this license means that you can inspect and modify the source code and guarantees that you will always have access to a QGIS based field data collection app that is free of cost and can be freely modified. You can find the sourcecode on github Support \u00b6 You can ask your questions on gis.stackexchange You can use the user mailing list We also provide commercial support, contact us Make it grow, make it yours \u00b6 This is a list of features which we think are very useful for a nice user experience and an effective workflow. Edit widgets \u00b6 Edit widgets are a core part of efficient field work. Entering attributes on a touch device is one of the jobs that takes the most time and keeping this task as easy as possible is key for pleasuring work. Some important edit field widgets are already available<old_edit_field_widgets> but much more is possible for example in QGIS . Legend \u00b6 To properly interpret the contents of a map, a legend is a very useful tool. It gives a user the required context to understand the semantic meaning of colors, shapes, strokes and other visual coding. It can also be used to access additional meta data of individual layers or chose which layer to work on. Connection based on-/offline synchronization \u00b6 Data collection is one of the domains where QField can help a lot. The final destination of data is normally not on the device itself but somewhere on a database. Currently it is possible to directly work on the database but since network access is often unreliable when in the field, it boils down to manual synchronization on a desktop computer. It would be great to have a synchronization process running on the devices where data will be synchronized automatically with a server when the network is available and cache data locally whenever no network connection is available. This may be combined with GeoGIG or other server components like a database. Improved coordinate precision \u00b6 Computers work mostly with two different datatypes for storing decimals (floating point numbers) internally. Single and double precision. With single precision only the first 6 digits of a number are significant and can be trusted, with double precision the first 15 digits can be trusted. This takes all digits (before and after the decimal point) into account. When working with coordinates this is very important when a high accurracy is required. Only having 6 significant digits often means having a maximum accurracy around one meter but depends on the CRS and location on the earth surface. Some parts of QField currently treat coordinates with single point precision. It would be a very good improvement to be able to use the full precision of accurate positioning devices by fixing this shortcoming. Saving GPS status information into attributes \u00b6 Positioning devices offer more information than just latitude and longitude. They are also able to estimate the precision which they are currently able to provide. This information can be a radius calculated from variables like the number of satellites but also additional flags for parameters like the RTK status. Editing geometries \u00b6 QField offers to digitize new geometries, edit existing attributes or delete features. What it lacks is the feature to edit existing geometries. This can be split into different pieces like moving points, moving other features, editing vertices, moving edges... Search functionality \u00b6 Locating features with the help of a search field is something that can really help to work more efficient. In general this can be split into two categories: Attribute based search Search results are provided based on the attributes of features on layers within the project. Either a local database for searching is available. The data inside is based on the customized data you work with or the layers are queried directly for features with attributes in question. Geocoding Search results are provided based on real world addresses. Services like Nominatim can be accessed via a web interface and convert real-world addresses to locations on a map. Just try the link. External measurement devices \u00b6 Are you working with external devices with sensors? Air pressure, temperature, slope, carbon monoxide concentration, you name it... Wouldn\\'t it be great to not having to read the information from your external device and manually typing it again? We would love to make life easier for you by adding support for directly connecting your external measurement device to QField. Record Audio \u00b6 Ever wondered how you would write a lot of text when out in the field with a touch screen? Just don\\'t! It would be amazing to have the possibility to have audio integration just like image integration. When back in the office, you could just type in the information on a regular keyboard. Open QGS files on click \u00b6 Simply open a QGIS project in QField by clicking on it in your file manager. [Your favorite feature] \u00b6 You probably have plenty of ideas for other nice features.

On choosing \\\"Open project\\\" from the QField menu, the file selector will be opened showing the following locations: The primary media/shared storage directory. The application-specific directories on all shared/external storage devices where the application can place persistent files it owns if they are not already included in the primary storage directory. Inside these directories, only subdirectories and files with the \\\".qgs\\\" extension are shown. QField requires the project file to be physically on the device, so it is not possible to use providers that work with remote files (e.g. Google Drive). On the other hand you can use apps like syncthing or nextcloud (or dropbox and probably many others) that allow you tho physically sync the file to your device. Favorite directories \u00b6 In the first screen of the file selector, there is a section showing the favorite directories. To add a directory to the favorites, long click in the file selector on the directory name. To remove an entry from the favorites, long click on the entry in the favorites list. External SD card \u00b6 The file selector shows the root of the SD card labeled as \\\"read-only\\\" and the application-specific directory separated from the rest of the SD card, as it is the only directory for which the app has write access.

This is important if you keep the data in the External sd card. How to turn external SD card into internal storage \u00b6 Starting from Android 6.0, you can use the SD card as internal storage for your Android phone. A feature called Adoptable Storage allows the Android OS to format an external storage media as a permanent internal storage. The data on the adopted SD card is encrypted and it can't be mounted on another device. Please be sure you start with an empty SD card. It needs to be empty because when the card is converted to \\\"Internal\\\" storage, it will be formatted (wiped). Go to device \"Settings\", then select \"Storage\". Select your \\\"SD Card\\\", then tap the \"three-dot menu\" (top-right), now select \"Settings\" from in there. Now select \"Format as internal\", and then \"Erase & Format\". Your SD Card will now be formatted as internal storage. Reboot your phone. If you don\\'t reboot the phone, many things may not work correctly, so make sure you do. It might be possible that the Adoptable Storage feature is not present on your device even if it is running Android 6.0 and above. The device manufacturer may have disabled the feature.

It\\'s possible to add, delete and open them. The visual identification of the list entries are done a Display Expression on the child layer.

Therefore we recommend to use stable values such as UUIDs for primary keys. Child features can be added before the parent is finaly saved - means while adding a parent. But it\\'s blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated. In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after there have been some childs added already, the childs are deleted by cascade. Many-To-Many relations On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the QGIS Vector Layer Properties, on adding, deleting or opening an entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality). The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the Display Expression needs to be set on the linking table.

Drag and drop designer forms \u00b6 Groups and Tabs from Drag and Drop designer forms are supported. Conditional visibility \u00b6 Groups can be hidden based on an expression. This is useful when certain attributes are only required under certain conditions. As an example imagine mapping trees. Some of them might have a disease and you have a list of possible deseases. To not clutter the form with many fields, make a group and configure a visibility expression for a group \\\"diseases\\\". Add a field \\\"desease\\\" with a checkbox. Only when the checkbox is checked, the list of diseases will be available to the user. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Constraints \u00b6 Attribute fields can have constraints attached. Constraints are expressions that needs to evaluate to True (or 1 ) in order to be able to save the form. Constraints are configured on a per-field basis and a description can be added that will be shown to the user if a constraint is not satisfied. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Common use cases \u00b6 You cannot enter an elevation value higher than the highest mountain in this country. \"elevation\" < 5000 It is required to fill in an identifier. \"identifier\" IS NOT NULL Default values \u00b6 Fields can have default values configured. Default values are inserted into the attribute form when digitizing a new feature. They are visible to the user and can be modified as long as the field is editable. They can be based on the geometry or expression variables. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} ::: Additional variables \u00b6 In QField, there are some additional variables available regarding the current positioning information. [position_coordinate]{.title-ref} (Geometry in WGS84!) : Lon, Lat, Altitude as delivered by the sensor. Is also available when the crosshair is not snapped to the sensor. [position_timestamp]{.title-ref} (DateTime) : Timestamp of the position information [position_direction]{.title-ref} (float) : Direction in degrees from true north. [position_ground_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : Groundspeed in meters / second. [position_magnetic_variation]{.title-ref} (float) : The angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and true north, in degrees. Also known as magnetic declination. A positive value indicates a clockwise direction from true north and a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise direction. [position_horizontal_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The vertical accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : The value of the vertical speed in meters per second. Common use cases \u00b6 Insert positioning information as variable: @ position_horizontal_accuracy Insert the current date and time: now () Insert the length of the digitized line: length ( $ geometry ) Configure global variables on the device and insert them. @ operator_name If you want to assign a region code based on the location where a new feature is inserted, you can do so by using an aggregate expression: aggregate ( layer : = 'regions' , aggregate : = 'max' , expression : = \"code\" , filter : = intersects ( $ geometry , geometry ( @ parent ) ) ) Editable \u00b6 The editable flag of fields is respected. Remember last values \u00b6 QField offers a much more fine-grained control over the last used values and ignores the QGIS setting. Snapping \u00b6 While digitizing new features, new points can be snapped to existing geometries. All configuration can be done in Project --> Snapping Settings ( Settings --> Snapping Settings {.interpreted-text role=\"menuselection\"} in QGIS 2.x). Snapping Types \u00b6 It is possible to snap new points only to nodes of existing geomtries only to segments of existing geomtries to nodes and segments of existing geomtries Snapping to layers \u00b6 It is also possible to only snap to one or a few layers. Snapping tolerance \u00b6 The snapping tolerance can be specified in map units or pixels. In almost any case, the units should be set to pixels. We made good experiences with a tolerance value of 20. 3D Coordinates \u00b6 GPS devices are capable of measuring the altitude next to the current 2D position on the earth surface.

QFieldSync supports your project preparation with automating the following: Required steps for project setup (e.g. old_portable_project ) Creating basemaps from a single raster layer or from a style defined in a map theme. Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow \u00b6 To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation \u00b6 In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . Configuration \u00b6 The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration \u00b6 In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration \u00b6 A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration \u00b6 If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield \u00b6 Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes.

QFieldSync supports your project preparation with automating the following: Required steps for project setup (e.g. portable_project ) Creating basemaps from a single raster layer or from a style defined in a map theme. Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow \u00b6 To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation \u00b6 In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . Configuration \u00b6 The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration \u00b6 In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration \u00b6 A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration \u00b6 If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield \u00b6 Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes. Synchronize from Qfield \u00b6 When you want to synchronize what you have collected, re-open the project in QGIS (the one you saved with a regular Save As). Copy the project folder from your device to your computer and use the Synchronize from Qfield menu to synchronize your changes from the protable project to the main project.
